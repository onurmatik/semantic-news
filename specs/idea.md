# semantic.news – Build a Collective Memory

## Overview

**semantic.news** is an open-source platform and global model aimed at building a *collective memory* by organizing and relating significant events with the support of artificial intelligence and human curation. Initially inspired by the project *Genel İzleyici*, it offers a new way to track, contextualize, and remember what's happening in the world—particularly in environments where media is polarized, fragmented, or shallow.

## Vision

- Help journalists, researchers, and engaged citizens **make sense of events over time**.
- Provide tools to **relate incidents**, **track developments**, and **reveal connections**.
- Democratize memory-building by allowing users to **curate topics** and contribute meaningfully.
- Offer a **globally applicable**, **open-source** framework that can be used in any region, with any language.

## Problem

In many societies, especially those with limited media freedom or high polarization, public understanding is shaped by noise rather than clarity. News is often superficial, fragmented, and quickly forgotten. There's a critical need for tools that allow people to:

- Remember what happened.
- Understand how events relate to each other.
- Reconstruct cause-and-effect chains over months or years.
- Create a persistent historical context.

## Solution

### Core Concept

A **collaborative platform** supported by **AI agents** that helps users curate and relate events under user-defined **topics**. Each topic acts as a growing folder of meaning, collecting and connecting news items, documents, and transcripts.

### Features

#### 🧠 Build a Collective Memory

- Keep an **ever-growing record of significant incidents**.
- Link events, articles, and sources under thematic umbrellas.
- Provide a public archive of context and chronology.

#### 🔍 AI-Powered Event Discovery

- Periodically fetch and analyze content from:
  - RSS news feeds
  - YouTube video transcripts
  - Social media posts (optional)
- Store content with **semantic embeddings** for similarity search and clustering.

#### 🧩 Human Curation + AI Assistance

- Users **create topics**, define their scope, and add notes.
- AI suggests related events, older references, and potential developments.
- Incidents can be **tagged, related, commented**, and **ranked by relevance**.

#### 🌍 Globally Applicable Architecture

- Language-agnostic core with pluggable language modules.
- Open data formats and APIs for integration with other tools.
- Customizable UI/UX for local contexts or alternative deployments.

#### 📝 Collaborative Editing & Versioning

- Event entries and timelines are **editable** by multiple contributors.
- Version history tracks how collective memory evolves.

## Project Origins: *Genel İzleyici*

The initial version of this concept was launched as **Genel İzleyici**, a Turkish-language platform that contextualizes news by clustering events and helping users understand their evolution.

Genel İzleyici emerged as a response to:

- The loss of memory in polarized media environments.
- The difficulty of accessing context behind breaking news.
- The public’s need for a clear and navigable record of political and social developments.

Its features—AI-assisted news curation, timeline creation, and thematic clustering—form the foundation of **semantic.news**, reimagined now as an open-source, globally reusable platform.
